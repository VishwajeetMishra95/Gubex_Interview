The file contains details of various countries and their unemployment ratios. My analysis primarily focuses on the following three aspects:

1)Countries Above or Below the Global Average:
Analyzed and identified countries with unemployment ratios either above or below the overall average unemployment ratio across all countries.

2) Year-on-Year Comparison Between India and the United States:
Conducted a detailed year-over-year analysis comparing unemployment ratios for India and the United States to understand trends and differences over time.

3) Classification of Countries Based on Unemployment Ratios:
Categorized countries into four distinct groups (Low, Moderate, High and very high) based on their unemployment ratios.
